# Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

### Overview:
The Employee Salary Calculator is a web application designed to streamline the process of adding and managing employee information. Users can input details such as first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. The application will dynamically update a table with the entered employee data and calculate the monthly budget based on the aggregated annual salaries. If the monthly budget exceeds 
$20,000, the display will turn red to alert users.

### Objectives:
1. Efficient Data Entry: Provide a user-friendly interface for quickly entering employee information.
1. Real-time Display: Ensure that the table displaying employee details is updated in real-time as new entries are added.
1. Accurate Budget Calculation: Implement accurate monthly budget calculations based on aggregated annual salaries.
1. Visual Alert: Implement a visual alert mechanism to notify users when the monthly budget exceeds $20,000.

### Technologies Used:
